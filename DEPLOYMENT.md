# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide

## Method 1: Direct Drag & Drop (Recommended for Quick Setup)

### Step 1: Prepare Build Files
Your production build is already ready in the `build/` folder!

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify
1. **Visit Netlify**: Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/log in
2. **Drag & Drop**: Go to your Netlify dashboard and drag the entire `build` folder onto the deployment area
3. **Instant Deploy**: Your site will be live immediately with a random URL like `amazing-newton-123456.netlify.app`

### Step 3: Custom Domain (Optional)
- Click "Domain settings" in your Netlify dashboard
- Add your custom domain or change the subdomain

---

## Method 2: Git-Based Deployment (Recommended for Continuous Deployment)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "🚀 Initial commit - Logistics Dashboard"

# Create repository on GitHub and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/logistics-dashboard.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Connect to Netlify
1. **New Site**: In Netlify dashboard, click "New site from Git"
2. **Connect GitHub**: Choose GitHub and authorize Netlify
3. **Select Repository**: Pick your `logistics-dashboard` repository
4. **Build Settings**: Netlify will auto-detect settings, but verify:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `build`
   - **Node version**: `18` (set in netlify.toml)

### Step 3: Deploy
- Click "Deploy site"
- Netlify will build and deploy automatically
- Future pushes to main branch will trigger automatic deployments
